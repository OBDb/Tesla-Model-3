    description: "The Tesla Model 3 represented the company's long-promised 'affordable' electric vehicle, designed to bring Tesla technology and performance to a broader market segment than the more expensive Model S and Model X. Unveiled in March 2016 and introduced in 2017, the Model 3 established a unique visual identity with its minimalist exterior design, clean lines, distinctive glass roof extending from windshield to rear window, and a near-grille-less front fascia. Initially available in rear-wheel drive single-motor and all-wheel drive dual-motor configurations, with various battery capacities offering ranges from approximately 220 to 310 miles depending on variant, the Model 3 delivered impressive performance with 0-60 mph times ranging from 5.6 seconds in base models to 3.1 seconds in the Performance variant. The interior introduced Tesla's ultra-minimalist approach with almost all controls relegated to a central 15.4-inch landscape-oriented touchscreen and nearly no physical buttons, creating a uniquely clean, futuristic cabin aesthetic. Standard features included Autopilot driver assistance capabilities, over-the-air software updates, and access to Tesla's Supercharger network, while premium features like improved audio systems and heated seats were included in higher trim levels. Manufacturing challenges during the initial production ramp in 2017-2018, dubbed 'production hell' by CEO Elon Musk, gradually resolved as Tesla mastered the challenges of mass production. In November 2020, the Model 3 received exterior and interior styling changes carried over from the Model Y, including black-finished door handles, side mirror trim, window trim, and camera covers, along with a heat pump with octovalve for improved climate control, a power-operated trunk, and a redesigned center console with Qi wireless charging pads. In June 2021, the Model 3 became the first electric car to pass global sales of 1 million units, and from July 2017 through 2023, it was the world's top-selling electric vehicle until briefly superseded by the Tesla Model Y crossover."

    description: "Tesla announced a major design refresh of the Model 3 on September 1, 2023, bringing a longer driving range, lower production costs, technical improvements, and a restyled exterior and interior. During development, the refresh was codenamed 'Project Highland' and was exhibited at the 2023 Munich Motor Show. The refreshed Model 3 improved range by approximately 10%, largely from a lower and more aerodynamic nose along with a better rear diffuser and more aerodynamic wheels. The drag coefficient improved from 0.225 Cd. Exterior changes included redesigned tail lights that eliminated the vertical break between trunk and side, new headlights, taillights, and wheels. Interior additions included an 8-inch touchscreen for rear seat passengers with Bluetooth audio capability, ventilated front seats, up to a 17-speaker sound system (up from 14), customizable interior accent lighting, and a new steering wheel without turn signal and gear selector stalks (controls moved to steering wheel buttons and touchscreen). The upgrade featured Frequency Selective Damping shock-absorbing technology. Gigafactory Shanghai was the first to begin making the refreshed Model 3, with availability in China and export markets including Europe, the Middle East, Australia, and Japan. The refreshed Model 3 became available for order in North America on January 10, 2024, with these models produced at the Tesla Fremont Factory. The update came equipped with HW4 camera and processing technology, which permitted a wider field of view and improved Autopilot's cross-traffic emergency braking."
