    description: "The Tesla Model 3 represented the company's long-promised 'affordable' electric vehicle, designed to bring Tesla technology and performance to a broader market segment than the more expensive Model S and Model X. Unveiled in March 2016 and introduced in 2017, the Model 3 established a unique visual identity with its minimalist exterior design, clean lines, distinctive glass roof extending from windshield to rear window, and a near-grille-less front fascia. Initially available in rear-wheel drive single-motor and all-wheel drive dual-motor configurations, with various battery capacities offering ranges from approximately 220 to 310 miles depending on variant, the Model 3 delivered impressive performance with 0-60 mph times ranging from 5.6 seconds in base models to 3.1 seconds in the Performance variant. The interior introduced Tesla's ultra-minimalist approach with almost all controls relegated to a central 15.4-inch landscape-oriented touchscreen and nearly no physical buttons, creating a uniquely clean, futuristic cabin aesthetic. Standard features included Autopilot driver assistance capabilities, over-the-air software updates, and access to Tesla's Supercharger network, while premium features like improved audio systems and heated seats were included in higher trim levels. Manufacturing challenges during the initial production ramp in 2017-2018, dubbed 'production hell' by CEO Elon Musk, gradually resolved as Tesla mastered the challenges of mass production, with quality and delivery timelines improving throughout the generation. In June 2021, the Model 3 became the first electric car to pass global sales of 1 million units, proving the viability of mass-market premium electric vehicles and prompting established automakers to accelerate their own electric vehicle development. From July 2017 through 2023, the Model 3 was the world's top-selling electric vehicle, maintaining its position until briefly superseded by the Tesla Model Y crossover. The first-generation Model 3 underwent a comprehensive facelift introduced in late 2023 (China/Gigafactory Shanghai) and early 2024 (North America/Fremont Factory), developed under the codename 'Project Highland,' representing a mid-cycle refresh with refinement, efficiency improvements, and manufacturing optimization while maintaining the fundamental architecture of the original platform. The Highland refresh (2023-present) featured redesigned front and rear fascias with slimmer headlights, more aggressive front bumper, and C-shaped taillights for improved aerodynamics; interior updates including a streamlined dashboard, higher quality materials, ambient lighting, ventilated front seats, and a new 8-inch rear passenger touchscreen; and mechanical refinements such as improved suspension tuning for enhanced ride comfort, additional sound insulation, a new steering wheel without stalks, and revised heat pump system for more efficient climate control. Battery and powertrain options continued with rear-wheel drive single-motor and all-wheel drive dual-motor configurations, offering slightly improved range figures of approximately 272 to 340 miles depending on variant, with 0-60 mph times ranging from 5.8 seconds in the base model to 3.1 seconds in the Performance variant."
